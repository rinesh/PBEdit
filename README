Disclaimer: PBEdit is in no way affiliated to Pushbutton Engine. The name PBEdit does not and should not be considered or called Pushbutton Edit, it’s just simply PBEdit.
 PBEdit is an incomplete Pushbutton engine editor. It was a personal project of mine which I started working on in July 2010 and worked on for about 2 months. 
 This was my first attempt at making a game editor. I wanted to make one for some time now. Later I got busy with work and abandoned the projects. Recently I thought to make 
the source code public, it might be useful for someone if not the whole thing at least bits and parts of it could be useful to learn from.
